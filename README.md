Display netatmo weather station on M5Paper

## The beginning...
A couple of months ago I decided to replace my old fashined weather station at home with something more up to date.

I decided to go for a netatmo weather station with an outdoor sensor. 
I didn't care about the missing display because it has a nice app.

I got the weather station and installed it. 
From now on everytime I wanted to check the temperature outside I had to take my mobile and open the netatmo app.

Well... after a couple of weeks I found it quite annoying to take the mobile just to check the temperature outside.

So I started to investigatre if there is a way to display the netatmo weather station data on a third party display.

After some hours of searching, reading and evaluation I found this:

I managed to buy an used one but in good shape.
