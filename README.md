Display netatmo weather station on M5Paper
A couple of months ago I decided to replace my old fashined weather station at home with something more up to date.
I decided to go for a netatmo weather station with an outdoor sensor. I didn't care about the missing display because it has a nice app.
I got the weather station and installed it. From now on everytime I wanted to check the temperature outside I had to take my mobile and open the netatmo app.
Well... after a couple of weeks I found it quite annoying to take the mobile just to check the temperature outside.
